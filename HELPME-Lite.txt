This is the File-Ninja-Lite HELPME file.


BASICS:
- Browse to Select
Select a directory to execute operations on.

- Browse to Exclude
Select subfolders of the main directory to exclude from operation. Hidden folders are automatically excluded. Only relevant if "Include Subfolders" is checked. To remove a previously added excluded directory, either double-click or right click it.

- Find procedures
Flags any errant files or folders based on the selection. Any find procedure that ends in "Error" adds to the error count on the summary sheet.

- Include Subfolders
If checked, will also traverse through all subfolders. Otherwise, will only traverse the selected directory. Read "Browse to Exclude".

- Execute
Execute operations given the settings.

- Results
Open results folder, containing Excel files of previous executions. File names follow the convention "<<SelectedFolderName>>-YY-mm-DD-HH-MM-SS.xlsx".

- Summary
Various metrics regarding the execution.



LEGEND for procedure names:
- "(Dir)"
Short for "Directory". Appended to procedures that flag errant directories, rather than files.



FIND PROCEDURES
Note: Any Find Procedure that ends in "Error" adds to the error count on the summary sheet.

- List All Files
Lists all files. Folders are only listed if they are not empty.

- List All Files (Owner)
Same as "List All Files" except it includes an owner column. Due to the extra operation, runs slower.

- Old File Error
Flags any file that has not been accessed in over 1095 days (i.e. 3 years). Note: windows has a glitch regarding the "last accessed" stat for a file, in that a file may be considered accessed even if it was not explicitly opened. This is not workaroundable, so run this find procedure and keep the resulting excel file handy before perusing through your files. Includes owner column.

- Identical Files Error
Flags files that are completely identical. Note: this is a very long, computationally expensive operation. Includes owner column.

- Empty File Error
Flags any file that is 0 bytes. Note: Some file types may be empty but are not 0 bytes, such as most Microsoft files. For instance, an empty excel file is still roughly 6kb in size. This is not workaroundable. Includes owner column.

- Empty Directory
Flags and folder that has 0 folders and 0 files within.

- Space Error
Flags file names with spaces.

- Space (Dir)
Flags folder names with spaces.

- Bad Character Error
Flags file names with bad characters. A bad character is any character that is either not alphanumeric, not a hyphen (-), or is a double hyphen (--).

- Bad Character (Dir)
Flags folder names with bad characters. A bad character is any character that is either not alphanumeric, not a hyphen (-), or is a double hyphen (--).

- Character Limit Error
Flags file paths over 200 characters. These files are not backed up.

- Large File Size
List all file extensions found, along with their count and average size. Any file extension with an average size over 100MB is flagged.

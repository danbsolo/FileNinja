This is the File-Ninja-Admin HELPME file.


BASICS:
- Browse to Select
Select a directory to execute operations on.

- Browse to Exclude
Select subfolders of the main directory to exclude from operation. Hidden folders are automatically excluded. Only relevant if "Include Subfolders" is checked. To remove a previously added excluded directory, either double-click or right click it.

- Find procedures
Flags any errant files or folders based on the selection. Any find procedure that ends in "Error" adds to the error count on the summary sheet.

- Fix procedures (ADMIN ONLY)
If "Allow Modify" is unchecked, flags any errant files or folders based on the selection, showing would-be fixes. If "Allow Modify" is checked, executes said fixes.

- Parameter (ADMIN ONLY)
Fix Procedures that end in "#" require an argument. Input their arguments here. If "Allow Modify" is unchecked and running multiple fix procedures, separate arguments using "/". Any fix procedures that do not require an argument are ignored. Arguments are assigned 1-1 from top to bottom of the selected fix procedures, left to right of the parameter field. For example, if running "Replace Space with Hyphen", "Replace Characters (File)#", "Delete Old Files#", and "Delete Empty Directories#" at once, you may type (without the quotes) "& > -and- / 1000 / 1".

- Include Subfolders
If checked, will also traverse through all subfolders. Otherwise, will only traverse the selected directory. Read "Browse to Exclude".

- Allow Modify (ADMIN ONLY)
If checked, executes all changes irreversibly. If unsure, ALWAYS leave this unchecked. Note: if checked, cannot run multiple fix procedures simultaneously.

- Include Hidden Files (ADMIN ONLY)
If checked, includes hidden files in output for Find procedures only. Fix procedures always ignore hidden files.

- Execute
Execute operations given the settings.

- Results
Open results folder, containing Excel files of previous executions. File names follow the convention "<<SelectedFolderName>>-YY-mm-DD-HH-MM-SS.xlsx".

- Summary
Various metrics regarding the execution.



LEGEND for procedure names:
- "Error"
Adds to the total file error count on the summary sheet.

- "(Dir)"
Short for "Directory". Appended to procedures that flag errant directories, rather than files.

- "#" (ADMIN ONLY)
Procedure uses and requires an argument.



FIND PROCEDURES
Note: Any Find Procedure that ends in "Error" adds to the error count on the summary sheet.

- List All Files
Lists all files. Folders are only listed if they are not empty.

- List All Files (Owner)
Same as "List All Files" except it includes an owner column. Due to the extra operation, runs slower.

- Old File Error
Flags any file that has not been accessed in over 1095 days (i.e. 3 years). Note: windows has a glitch regarding the "last accessed" stat for a file, in that a file may be considered accessed even if it was not explicitly opened. This is not workaroundable, so run this find procedure and keep the resulting excel file handy before perusing through your files. Includes owner column.

- Identical Files Error
Flags files that are completely identical. Note: this is a very long, computationally expensive operation. Includes owner column.

- Empty File Error
Flags any file that is 0 bytes. Note: Some file types may be empty but are not 0 bytes, such as most Microsoft files. For instance, an empty excel file is still roughly 6kb in size. This is not workaroundable. Includes owner column.

- Empty Directory
Flags and folder that has 0 folders and 0 files within.

- Space Error
Flags file names with spaces.

- Space (Dir)
Flags folder names with spaces.

- Bad Character Error
Flags file names with bad characters. A bad character is any character that is either not alphanumeric, not a hyphen (-), or is a double hyphen (--).

- Bad Character (Dir)
Flags folder names with bad characters. A bad character is any character that is either not alphanumeric, not a hyphen (-), or is a double hyphen (--).

- Character Limit Error
Flags file paths over 200 characters. These files are not backed up.

- Large File Size
List all file extensions found, along with their count and average size. Any file extension with an average size over 100MB is flagged.



FIX PROCEDURES (ADMIN ONLY)
Note:
> If you are unsure, always leave "Allow Modify" unchecked.
> Hidden files are ignored.

- Delete Old Files#
Deletes any files that has not been accessed in a set number of days or in a range. Read "Old File Error" find procedure for more information. Requires argument. Includes owner column. Example 1: With the argument set to "500", any file that has not been accessed in 500 days or more will get deleted. Example 2: With the argument set to "100-120", any file that has not been accessed between 100 and 120 days (inclusive) will get deleted.

- Delete Empty Files
Deletes any file that is 0 bytes in size. Read "Empty File Error" find procedure for more information. Includes owner column.

- Delete Empty Directories#
Deletes any folder that both holds 0 folders and 0 files, and flags any folder that both holds 0 folders and has less files than the set argument. Requires argument. Example: With the argument set to "3", any folder that holds 0 folders and has 3 or less files will get flagged. Those with 0 files get deleted.

- Replace Space with Hyphen
Replaces all instances of spaces within file names with a hyphen and fixes bad hyphen usage. Example 1: "Engagement Tracker.txt" -> "Engagement-Tracker.txt". Example 2: "- Engagement - - Tracker -.txt" -> "Engagement-Tracker.txt". Example 3: "Engagement--Tracker.txt" -> "Engagement-Tracker.txt".

- Replace Space with Hyphen (Dir)
Replaces all instances of spaces within folder names with a hyphen and fixes bad hyphen usage.

- Replace Characters#
For file names, replaces substring with another substring, using a ">" as separator between the replacer and replace pair, and "*" as a separator between pairs. Requires argument. WARNING: If running multiple pairs of arguments, one pair's replacer can undo the work of an earlier pair's replace; order can matter if not careful. Always double-check your output if unsure. Example 1: With the argument set to "& > -and-", all instances of "&" will be replaced with "-and-". Example 2: With the argument set to "@>-at- * &-and-", all instances of "@" will become "-at-", and all instances of "&" will become "-and-".

- Replace Characters (Dir)#
Same as the file version, except for directories. Note: if "Allow Modify" is checked and any find procedures are ran, the directory values in the find procedure sheets may be invalid. To circumvent this, when "Allow Modify" is checked, run this fix procedure separately.
